1. Predicting Diabetes Onset Using Logistic Regression
   Dataset: 
Diabetes Dataset   
Preprocessing Steps:
Handle missing values if any.
Standardize features.
Encode categorical variables if any.
  Task:
Implement logistic regression to predict diabetes onset and evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, and recall.

2. Classifying Iris Species Using Decision Trees
   Dataset: 
Iris Dataset
   Preprocessing Steps:
Handle missing values if any.
Standardize features.
Encode categorical variables if any.
   Task: 
Implement a decision tree classifier to classify iris species and evaluate the model using confusion matrix and accuracy.

3. Predicting Titanic Survival Using Logistic Regression
   Dataset: 
Titanic Dataset
   Preprocessing Steps:
Handle missing values (e.g., fill missing ages with median).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for embarked and gender).
Standardize numerical features.
   Task:
Implement logistic regression to predict survival on the Titanic and evaluate the model using ROC-AUC.

4. Classifying Emails as Spam Using Decision Trees

Dataset: 
Spam Email Dataset
Preprocessing Steps:
Handle missing values if any.
Standardize features.
Encode categorical variables if present.
Task: 
Implement a decision tree classifier to classify emails as spam or not and evaluate the model using precision, recall, and F1-score.
